				crypto assets) on behalf of users. Your use of a third-party Wallet is subject to separate terms and

				technology and that the use of such technology involves a high degree of risk. For example, there are
				numerous reasons the Tokens or Xai Network could fail in an unexpected way, resulting in the total and
				absolute loss of your Tokens. You hereby agree that you assume all risks in connection with your use of
				the Tokens and Xai Network and expressly waive and release the Company from any and all liability,
				claims, causes of action, or damages arising out of or in any way relating to you obtaining or using
				Tokens and Xai Network.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>3.2. You understand and accept the risk of operational challenges related to the Tokens and Xai
				Network. For example, the Xai Network may experience cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in transaction
				volume or activity, or other operational or technical difficulties or vulnerabilities that may cause
				interruptions related to your use of the Tokens or Xai Network. You agree to accept the risk of Tokens
				or Xai Network failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties or
				vulnerabilities, including those resulting from cyber-attacks. You agree not to hold the Company
				accountable for any related losses.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>3.3. You agree that the Company is not responsible for any Tokens or other crypto assets that you

				WARRANTY OR CONDITION SHALL BE APPLIED TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER SUCH APPLICABLE
				LAW.</strong></p>

				OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN ADDITION, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COMPANY'S

				conflict or choice of law rules.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.3. Nothing in these Terms will preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of
				arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.4. A party must notify the other party of its intent to commence arbitration prior to
				commencing arbitration. The notice must specify the date on which the arbitration demand is intended to
				be filed, which must be at least thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. During this time period,
				the parties will meet for the purpose of resolving the dispute prior to commencing arbitration.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.5. Subject to Section 6.4, each party may commence arbitration by providing to the BVI

			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.6. Subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability stated in these Terms, the appointed
				arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the British Virgin
				Islands (including the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules). In making a determination, the arbitrator will not
				have the authority to modify any term of these Terms. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned, written
				decision with respect to the dispute to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the
				arbitrator’s decision. Any award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed in or enforced
				by a state or federal court located in the British Virgin Islands. The decision of the arbitrator will
				be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.7. The party initiating the arbitration is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee.
				Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance
				of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any
				arbitration arising out of or relating to these Terms, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing
				party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection
				with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and
				legal fees awards will be offset.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>

				disclose the arbitrator’s decision in confidential settlement negotiations; (d) each party may disclose
				as necessary to professional advisors that are subject to a strict duty of confidentiality; and (e) as
				applicable law otherwise requires. The parties, witnesses and arbitrator will treat as confidential and
				will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other
				evidence produced in any arbitration, except as applicable so requires or if the evidence was obtained
				from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.9. In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 6 and the BVI IAC
				Arbitration Rules, the provisions of this Section 6 shall prevail.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.10. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any dispute arising out of or relating to these
				Terms, whether in arbitration or in court, shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a
				class, consolidated or representative action. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms or the
				BVI IAC Arbitration Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of
				this class waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or
				consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither party is entitled to
				arbitration.</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p className="pl-8"><strong>6.11. If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration,
				each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
